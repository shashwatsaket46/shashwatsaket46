### 🧠 About Me
Curretnly I'm a Masters student in Computer Science at New York University focussed in Machine Learning model and architectural improvements.\n
Also I was an **Ex-Software Engineer at CGI Inc.**, where I worked in integrating **AI** into credit studio systems through advanced camunda BPMNs.\n  
I love blending **deep representational models** with **insightful architecture**, crafting systems that scale — and inspire.  

### 🏆 Achievements
- 🥇 *Credit Studio Star Award (Q1 2025)* for integrating AI modules & leading a smooth production deployment.  
- 🚀 Collaborated with Product Managers & Tech Leads to design system architecture and drive feature delivery.  
- 💡 Delivered multiple backend components amalgamated with AI models (Spring Boot, Kafka, , Fast API, Deep Learning - BERT, BLSTM - NLP ).
